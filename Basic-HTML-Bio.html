  <p>Loraine is the kind of person who loves the stars. For as long as I can remember I have always had a passion and curiosity for science. I am almost 23 years old now, and I am close to becoming the person I have always wanted to be.</p>
  <p>I attend UTSA with major in Physics and minor in Astrophysics. I am a senior and only have roughly a year left till I complete my bachelors. I plan to use my coding and analyst skills to one day get my dream job. My dream job is to study the stars, and that job would be an Astronomer.</p>
